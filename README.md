Articulate Storyline Information Literacy Modules
=============================

Interactive Articulate Storyline modules developed to teach undergraduates information literacy skills such as narrowing a topic, evaluating sources and citing. To see working examples of these modules, please checkout the GitHub Page for this project.

Customization
=============

To customize or edit the modules you will need to have [Articulate Storyline](https://www.articulate.com/products/storyline-why.php). The files were developed in Storyline, you do NOT need Storyline 2 to edit these files. 

The modules were developed to be used as SCORM packages in a Learning Management System (LMS). If you intend to use these modules outside of an LMS, on a website for example, you can remove a number of slides from the modules.


Installation
============

Open the Storyline file, then follow the instructions below that relate to where you will be deploying these modules, i.e. an LMS or a website.
